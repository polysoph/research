Some questions to ask scientific researchers during interviews: 

* How would you describe your research process? What are the steps you go through?
* What information tools and processes do you use to conduct research?
* How do you currently share information? Is it one-off (someone asks, I email them things), or is it systematic (working in the open such as with Github)?
* How do you apply for grants?
* How do you measure research impact for grants?
