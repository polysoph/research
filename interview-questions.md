Some questions to ask scientific researchers during interviews: 

### "Wide" Questions

* What do you research?
* How large is the team you're working on?
* How would you describe your research process? What are the steps you go through?
* How do you contribute to research projects other than your own?

### "Narrow" Questions

* What kinds of information tools and processes do you use to conduct research?
* How do you work with other people on your team? How do you share information with them?
* What would your ideal research team look like for your current area of study? Who around the world has knowledge about your area of inquiry?
* What do you do when you encounter a problem outside of your skill set?
* How do you apply for grants?
* How do you measure research impact for grants?

### Interview Result Analysis Questions

Some questions to help me interpret and understand the responses:

* How do they communicate? Is the process one-off (eg. emails) or is it systematic ("working in the open")? Draw a diagram about it.
