# Planning

## Design Challenge

How can we better allow the intermingling of ideas and disciplines within science?

1. To improve the accessiblity of science
2. To improve the quality of ideas

## Platform Ideas

Here's a dumping of ideas I've had while doing research. These will later need to be prioritized and validated.

* Track contributions ([like Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo/graphs/contributors)), to allow universities and grant organizations to see how much they've contributed to specific bits of research.
* Allow users to reference other works on the platform in their writing, as well as works recorded elsewhere (Google Scholar).
* See a chain of citations and references for the research (What is this problem/question drawing on? what did those things draw upon?)
* Document progress on idea development through a ["pull request"](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo/pull/32) style view. All relevant work and conversation is brought to one place.
* Allow users to follow updates for a given problem or a given field (cross-disciplinarity)
* Providing DOIs for contributions. Github started doing this (source: Jamie Elwick)
* Getting results into [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com). It sounds like this is an integral part of hiring meetings, so having results appear in GS ensures a base level of community acceptance ([source](https://youtu.be/Kf2qO0plUKs?t=42m20s))
* Version controlled documents, semantically released. In other words, Github's "tags" as published papers. This model allows for revisions and edits, but still lets you trace things back to the original source.
* Allow writing of a culminatory paper in the tool? Mostly because it would allow us to prompt them to submit the research to open journals, and provide tools for automated review about format and structure.
* Research question prizes? Work with organizations? Similar to [Innocentive](http://www.innocentive.com).
* LaTeX or MathML rendering in comments (killer feature for physicists and mathematicians)

## Platform Questions

##### Meta

* Is this about large and unsolvable scientific problems? Or is this about an everyday tool? Which is more valuable? To whom?

##### Conceptual

* How can we improve the development of scientific knowledge?
* How can we design a tool that allocates expert attention optimally? ([source](https://youtu.be/Kf2qO0plUKs?t=12m12s))
* How can we restructure the culture of science to accept non-standard forms of contribution? ie. beyond papers and grant submissions ([source]())
* How can we establish a cultural link between sharing knowledge and career success for scientists?
* How can we get adoption to new platforms for scientific working? ([many seem to fail](https://youtu.be/Kf2qO0plUKs?t=18m30s))
  * How can we encourage institutional adoption?

##### Technical

* How do we handle research data that needs to remain anonymous?
* How do we give credit to contributors?
* Whose job is it to write something up into a completed paper? Are papers even the goal?
* How do you manage discussions with various "threads"?
* Should we connect researchers who are asking similar questions? Getting the same expers together? (See [the example of Richard Tilley](http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Nanoscience/Sci-Media/Video/Scientists-working-together))


## Sample Content

##### Examples

* [P=NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem), computer science


##### Lists

* [List of unsolved problems in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics)
* [List of unsolved problems in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_computer_science)

## Notes

> "A brutally simple mental model of the software that’s shared by all users turns out to be a better predictor of adoption and value than a completely crazy collection of features that ends up being slightly different for every user."
